    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br>
    A burger is a patty of ground beef grilled and placed 
    between two halves of a bun. Slices of raw onion, lettuce,
     bacon, mayonnaise, and other ingredients add flavor. Burgers 
    are considered an American food but are popular around 
    the world!
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 x 500g pack British Beef Steak Mince 15% fat</li>
        <li>1 tsp mixed dried herbs</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>4 slices mature Cheddar (optional)</li>
        <li>4 white rolls</li>
        <li>few round lettuce leaves, torn</li>
        <li>1 beef tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>ketchup, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and
             cook for 5 minutes until softened and starting to
              turn golden. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg.
             Season, add the onions and mix well. Using your hands,
              shape into 4 patties.</li>
        <li>Cook the burgers on a preheated barbecue or griddle for 
            5-6 minutes on each side. While the second side is cooking,
             lay a slice of cheese on top to melt slightly (if using).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the
             barbecue. Fill with the lettuce,
             burgers and tomato slices. Serve with ketchup, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
